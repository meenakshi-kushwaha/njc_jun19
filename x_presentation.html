# Highlights

- Interventions are needed to lower household PM2.5 exposures  
--

- Participants were randomized to a control (no air cleaners) or intervention (1–2 air cleaners) group
--

- Air cleaners lowered indoor PM2.5 by 29% and blood cadmium by 14% 
--

- Air cleaners were most effective in winter
--

- Air cleaner effectiveness reduced by &gt;50% after ~ 5 months of use

# Background

- High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) Filter
- We spend majority of our time indoors
- Outdoor Air Pollution + Indoor Sources (smoking)
- Studies in HICs
  - reductions of 32–68% in concentration
  - short term (days, weeks)

# Ulaanbatar, Mongolia

- Capital City
- Population: 1.5 million
- Cold and polluted
- Annual average PM2.5 concentration ~ 70 μg/m3
- Wintertime PM2.5 dominated by residential heating with coal
  - Coal combustion is also associated with Cadmium
  - Coal use rising with increase in "Ger" neighborhoods

# Study Design
- 540 participants in each group

- Intervention household
  - 1 or 2 air purifiers
  - Disabled "mood-light"
  - timer data recorded
  - 1st purifier in living area and 2nd in bedroom 
  - HEPA filter was not changed during study
  
- Control household
 - no air purifier

# HEPA Filter
- High Efficiency Particle Filter
- Can remove at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria, and any airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns (µm)
- Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values, or MERVs
  - filter's ability to capture larger particles 
  - between 0.3 and 10 microns (µm)
  - value is helpful in comparing the performance of different filters
  - Higher MERV =&gt; better filter

# Data Collection
- Jan 2014 to Dec 2015
- At home and during clinic visits
- Dylos monitors for particle counts
- Gravimetric sampling in a subset of homes
- Blood samples for cadmium 
- Hair samples for nicotine (smoking exposure)

# Air Pollution Measurements
- Dylos laser particle counter
  - 2 ranges: &gt;0.5 μm and &gt;2.5 μm
  - logging at 5 min intervals
- Real time count was disabled to avoid bias
- Used diff of the 2 rangess for PM2.5 concentration
 - Dylos-PM2.5 correlation is 0.55 and 0.99
- Conducted colocations of all monitors
- Gravimetric analysis
  - 90 apartments, 20% of sample
  - convinience sample
  - Harvard Personal Env Monitors (HEPM)
  - 37 mm Teflon filters
  - 4L/min
- Monitors were placed on table or shelf in main activity room 
  - far from air cleaner, pollution sources, ventilation
- Outdoor measurements were done at two locations 
  - Govt run stations
  - TOEM monitors
- RH measurements at a subset of apartments  
???
These apartments represent a convenience sample because although they
were randomly chosen to capture a representative sample of intervention
and control apartments across multiple seasons, measurements
were only conducted if participants gave permission for additional sampling.

# Biological Samples
- Cadmium from blood samples
- Hair Nicotine
  - Marker of second hand tobacco smome
  - ~ 30-50 strands cut from scalp
  - Excluded people with chemically treated hair

# Randomized Control Trial

![RCT](images/fig4.png)
---
# Data Analysis
- Data cleaning  
  - Removal of 51% one-week Dylos measurements
  - Tested for differences in HH with and without Dylos data
- Effect of RH was negligible
  - Indoor RH never exceeded 85%
- Gravimetric PM 2.5 vs Dylos measurements showed strong correlation
  - R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.94, n = 23
  
---
# Dylos calibration
- Colocation with gravimetric sampler
- 100 filters
  - including 10 field blanks and 1 duplicate set
- Blank filters mean(sd) was 0.01 (0.02) µg
- Duplicate set in a single home showed high agreement
  - 15.4 and 16.0 µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
- 41 filter samples had to be discarded
  - incomplete data, or
  - differences of &gt; 10 % in start and stop pump flow rates
- Remaining 49 samples were matched with Dylos particle count data
  - 23 valid pairs of Dylos measurements and gravimetric PM2.5 samples 
- Conversion equation
  - PM2.5 (µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1.88 + 1.34*(Particle Count, particles/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), 
  - R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.94

# Results - PM2.5 concentration
- Reduced one-week indoor PM2.5 by 29%
  - More reduction for first measurment (40%)
  - Less reduction for 2nd measurement (15%)
![PM reduction](images/fig5.png)  
???
We observed larger reductions when the air cleaners were first deployed in early pregnancy (40%, 95% CI: 31, 48%), compared with after roughly five months of use

# Results
- Air cleaners reduced one-week indoor PM2.5 concentrations by 29% 
- Blood cadmium reduced by 14% 
- Larger PM2.5 reductions were seen for the first measurement (40%) vs second measurement (15%)
- Strong correlations between indoor and outdoor PM2.5 
- Largest reduction seen in winter months when mean concentrations reduced from 45 to 29 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
  - Filter effectiveness reducing over time
???
- Larger PM2.5 reductions were seen for the first measurement (40%) when the air cleaners were newly deployed, compared with the second measurement (15%), which was made after ~five months of air cleaner use
- We found strong correlations between indoor and outdoor PM2.5,indicating that outdoor PM2.5 contributed substantially to indoor concentrations.
- Since filter ef- fectiveness followed the same seasonal pattern as outdoor PM2.5 concentrations, the impact of the intervention on indoor PM2.5 concen- trations was extraordinarily large in the winter months, when the geo- metric mean was reduced from 45 to 29 μg/m3.
---
## Compliance
- Shutting off filter to reduce electricity use or noise
- In other studies compliance varies with time
  - ranges between 34 - 79%
----
## Blood Cadmium 
#### SHS is important source in this population
- Higher concentrations among participants living with smokers, compared with those in non-smoking households. 
- Higher correlations between blood cadmium and hair nicotine among participants who lived with smokers (r = 0.29) compared with those who did not (r = 0.10). 
- Lower concentrations among intervention participants, suggesting that airborne exposures were lower in this group. 
???
although blood cadmium concen- trations cannot definitively be linked to SHS exposures, we found three pieces of compelling evidence to suggest that SHS exposure was an im- portant source of cadmium in our population

# Limitations
- Participants not blinded to intervention
  - sham filters
- HEPA filters not replaced during the study
- Could not assess duration of filter use
  - Timer was flawed
- Data loss due to malfunction of low cost Dylos device
  - 447 one-week indoor PM2.5 measurements in 342 apartments
